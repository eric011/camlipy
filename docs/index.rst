=========
 Camlipy
=========

Unofficial Python client for `Camlistore <http://camlistore.org/>`_.

Camlipy try to behave exactly the same way that the original Camlistore Go client.
It means you can download file uploaded with ``camput`` or the web ui, and file uploaded with Camlipy works well with the ui and camget.
